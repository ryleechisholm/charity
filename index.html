          Bee hives only have a 5% spawn chance throughout the Minecraft world
          under the right conditions. This is no where near enough space for a
          healthy species of bee.  Every year tens of bees are dying due to this lack of homes.  Without bees, flowers would have very little pollination.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          For just 1 diamond a week, my crew will craft hives for the honeybees,
          as well as planting plenty of flowers to help populate the honeybee
          species.  Together, we will make a prettier and bee-filled Minecraft world.
